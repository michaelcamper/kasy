# Proposed Techlogy Stack for CTO Role at Kasy

## Strategic Rationale

This technology stack prioritizes rapid development, scalability, type safety, exceptional developer experience, robust security, and compliance—ideally suited to efficiently deliver a high-quality legal-tech platform focused on smarter case-law research in Switzerland.

Additionally, I've explicitly selected widely-used, battle-tested tools, frameworks, and services. This strategic decision ensures easier hiring and onboarding of developers, while also optimizing the effectiveness of modern AI-driven development tools and coding assistants (e.g., AI code agents, Cursor), which are extensively trained and perform best on popular, standardized technologies.

## Frontend Stack (React / Next.js)

- **Framework:** Next.js (SSR, SEO, developer-friendly)
- **Styling & UI Components:** Mantine UI (highly customizable, accessible, minimal boilerplate)
- **State Management:** React Query (primarily asynchronous data handling; minimal global state)
- **Data Visualization:** Recharts (integrates smoothly with Mantine)
- **UI Component Development & Validation:** Storybook (consistent component documentation, rapid prototyping, validation by legal business partners)

---

## Backend Stack (Next.js)

- **API Layer:** Next.js API Routes (minimal, sufficient for expected scale)
- **Type-Safe API:** tRPC (excellent DX, rapid development)
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Auth.js (robust integration, simplicity)
- **Full-Text Search:** Elasticsearch or Algolia (fast, efficient legal search)

---

## Database & Storage

- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL (reliable, scalable relational storage)
- **ORM:** Drizzle (lightweight, type-safe, minimal boilerplate)
- **File Storage:** Vercel Blob (integrated, secure file storage)
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone or Weaviate (semantic search & embeddings support)

---

## AI & Machine Learning (Python)

- **Framework:** LangChain (efficient AI orchestration)
- **Embeddings:** Dedicated embedding model (OpenAI, Cohere, SentenceTransformers—choice depends on further evaluation)
- **Python API Framework:** FastAPI (type-safe, rapid development, modern DX)
- **Python Deployment:** Render or Fly.io (simple, scalable, Vercel-like deployments)

---

## Infrastructure & DevOps

- **Deployment (Frontend/Next.js):** Vercel (CI/CD built-in, scalability)
- **Cloud Provider (if additional services required):** AWS or Google Cloud Platform
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Sentry (error monitoring, observability)
- **Security & Compliance:**
  - Arcjet (enhanced app security, protection against common attacks)
  - GDPR Compliance, OWASP Guidelines, Swiss Data Protection Standards

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit Testing:** Vitest (fast, modern unit testing)
- **End-to-End Testing:** Playwright (reliable, robust testing)

---

## Developer Productivity & Tooling

- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Continuous Integration:** GitHub Actions (automation of testing, builds, deployments)
- **Code Quality & Standards:** ESLint, Prettier, Conventional Commits
- **Documentation & Knowledge Management:** GitBook (team-friendly, comprehensive docs)

---

## Additional Considerations (outside direct product scope or pending requirements clarification)

- **Payments & Subscriptions:**  
  Payment provider supporting subscriptions and tiered pricing (e.g., Stripe).

- **User Quota & Rate Limits:**  
  Tool or middleware required for handling user quotas and API rate limiting, depending on subscription tiers.

- **Internal Communication & Team Collaboration:**  
  Preferred solution: Slack (due to robust integrations with existing stack—Sentry, Vercel, GitHub).

- **General Internal Infrastructure:**
  - Email (e.g., Google Workspace, Fastmail)
  - Internal File Storage & Document Management (e.g., Google Drive, Notion, Dropbox)
  - Calendar Management & Scheduling Tools (e.g., Google Calendar)

_(Specific choices in this section will depend on further business requirements and operational clarity.)_
