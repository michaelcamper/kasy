# Basic Security Plan for Protecting User Data

At Kasy, protecting user data is central to our platform. Below is an overview of how we'll ensure data security and privacy, designed with clarity for non-technical stakeholders.

## What We're Already Doing

### Secure Infrastructure & Reliable Hosting

- We host our platform on trusted providers like **Vercel**, ensuring built-in encryption and secure data handling.

### Robust Authentication & Authorization

- Our system uses proven tools like **Auth.js** to ensure secure logins and account protection.
- Sensitive logic and data remain on secure servers, not exposed in user browsers.

### Regular Security Monitoring

- Tools like **Sentry** allow us to detect and respond to potential issues quickly.

### Legal Compliance

- We follow industry standards, including **GDPR** and **Swiss Data Protection Regulations**, ensuring user data is handled legally and ethically.

## Additional Security Measures to Implement

To further enhance our protection, we'll implement the following:

### Enhanced User Account Security

- **Strong Passwords & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Ensuring accounts have strong passwords and additional verification steps to prevent unauthorized access.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Clearly defining user permissions so everyone only has access to the information necessary for their role.

### Audit Logging

- Tracking important user actions to help identify and respond swiftly to any unauthorized activity.

### Data Encryption

- Confirming and documenting encryption of user data stored in our databases, adding an extra security layer.

### Regular Backups

- Automated backups of user data securely stored off-site, ensuring quick recovery in case of issues.

### Incident Response Planning

- Clear, documented procedures for swiftly addressing security incidents and minimizing impact.

### Regular Security Audits

- Ongoing assessments of all third-party vendors and integrations, ensuring they meet our strict security standards.

### Data Privacy Enhancements

- Establishing clear policies for anonymizing user data, particularly during testing and troubleshooting, to further protect privacy.

## Additional Strategic Privacy Considerations (Advanced)

_(Note: These strategies are advanced and may require more technical resources, but they are highly important for the long-term privacy and data separation of our customers.)_

### Multi-Tenancy Architecture

- Using separate databases (including specialized databases like vector databases) for each tenant, ensuring maximum data isolation and reducing the risk of cross-contamination between different users or organizations.

### On-Premise / Self-Hosted AI Models

- Considering self-hosted AI models (e.g., large language models and embeddings) to retain complete control over sensitive data processing, further enhancing user privacy and compliance with stringent regulations.

These combined measures form a comprehensive security framework, ensuring user data at Kasy is protected with industry-leading standards.
